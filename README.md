# Clueblo
Minigame Map for Minecraft Version 1.16.3 and 1.18.2

## How to install

 1. Go to the [releases](https://github.com/Fietje/Clueblo/releases) and download the newest version.
 2. Unpack the .zip file and put the folder with the name **Clueblo** into your minecraft saves folder (if you want to play locally) or set it as your servers map file.
 3. Make sure that all players are using the resource pack from the .zip file named `Add_to_your_resource_pack_folder.zip`. The best option is to set it as the servers resource pack.
 4. If you have problems after adding the map restart your world/server or enter `/reload` in chat.
 5. If you only see clocks inside your inventory you are not using the right resource pack.

## How to play

 1. At the start of the map there is a button that when pressed explains all the rules.
 2. Apart of some small changes the rules are pretty much the same as normal Cluedo.
 3. If you want a small visual tutorial [watch this video](https://youtu.be/XM1lAUJjDo4).

## Languages

Clueblo supports the languages **English (US)** and **Deutsch (Deutschland)**.
You can change them at the start of the map (for the static map parts) and directly inside your game under **Languages** (for the dynamic parts).
If you see strange text in chat, on items or on some signs you are using the wrong language or the resource pack is not selected correctly.

## TODOs for 1.18.2

1. Resource pack number is not correct
2. Some dice have no more textures
